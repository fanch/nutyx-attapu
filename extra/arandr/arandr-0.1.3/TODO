 * add option to make layout default on startup by means of desktop environment integration
 * implement missing xrandr 1.2 features: reflect, additional modes (for forcibly applying saved layouts so they are already active when an output is connected), fb, fbmm/dpi
 * call xrandr without blocking
 * receive notifications on changes (XRRScreenChangeNotify)
  * useful resources: <http://www.mail-archive.com/sawfish-list@gnome.org/msg03630.html> (a patch to sawfish for xrandr event support), Xrandr.c (that defines XRRSelectInput), SelInput.c (compare XSelectInput /XRRSelectInput), ./eventdemo.py
 * don't reset displays moved over edges; instead, move as far as possible
 * allow setting dpi
 * integrate related settings: (might end up writing a complete configuration manager, which is not my intention)

  * xsetwacom
  * gnome-panel layout (is this 1.3's --primary?)

 * integrate new 1.3 features (projection matrix, panning)
 * be more intelligent about future xrandr versions (cf debian #523903)
 * read --props, parse edid (using parse-edid from read-edid), maybe even offer setting properties
